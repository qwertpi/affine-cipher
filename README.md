# affine-cipher
Some python for encrypting and decrypting with some forms of affine cipher  
[Live demo](https://repl.it/github/https://github.com/qwertpi/affine-cipher/)  
Feedback and pull requests are very welcome  

## LIMITATIONS
* I have not thouroghly tested the code
* It doesn't tell you the multiplier **yet**
* Like nearly affine tools it can only cope with multipliers that don't share any factors with 26
